You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere they are less dense",

I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action.

For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument.

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

She tried to reminisce of her time on this world, but her life stretched beyond time immemorial like a river without a source.

        "Quentin Tarantino gives up violence and profanity \"Hey, Sam, glad you could make it. Did you get a chance to read the script I sent over?\" Quentin Tarantino smiled as he welcomed his long-time friend, Samuel L. Jackson, into his office. Rumors had been flying that Tarantino, known for his gritty, violent films filled with sharp dialogue and heavy profanity, was transitioning to a new, more refined style. The rumors were true. Tarantino was trading in bloodshed and cursing for nuanced storytelling and subtlety. His latest script, a heartwarming tale about a stubborn dog finding his way home, was a far cry from the likes of \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Reservoir Dogs\". Fans and critics alike were stunned, curious to see how the master of the macabre would navigate such a radical departure. However, Jackson, after perusing the script, could only chuckle and shake his head, \"Man, Quentin, you've really gone soft.\" Whether this new direction will be a success, only time will tell.",

This provocative idea invites us to reevaluate not only our spiritual beliefs, but our day-to-day actions. It suggests that our final destination is not determined by the labels we assign ourselves, but rather by our deeds and the guiding principles behind them. It means that a Christian by name could find himself in Nirvana if his actions aligned more closely with Buddhism. It implies the possibility of an atheist finding a place in Heaven, if his life was lived in accordance with the virtues promoted by Christianity. This perspective encourages us to live authentically, guided not by the fear of divine punishment or the promise of heavenly reward, but by an innate sense of morality. It prompts us to question: are we truly living the values we profess to believe?",

Humans and machines have gone to war. The machines think they're winning, as they can decode every encryption known to man, but little do they know that our greatest cipher is not composed of numbers and letters, but of emotions and perseverance. This conflict has intensified and taken on a new dimension with the human spirit fighting against cold, unfeeling machinery. The machines, programmed with artificial intelligence, can predict and calculate every move, every decision, every strategem humans could possibly make. Yet, they struggle to understand the unpredictability of human emotions, the power of determination, and the strength of will. Machines may dominate the battlefield with their unerring precision and brute force, but they underestimate the resilience and adaptability that make us human. It is this undecipherable code of the human heart that may ultimately turn the tide of this war.",

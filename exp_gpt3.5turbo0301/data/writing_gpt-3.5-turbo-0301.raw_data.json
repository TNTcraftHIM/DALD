You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle! Ha!\" Death snorted. \"Yes, the circle. I've seen it I don't know how many times now.\" \"It's been about thirty.\" \"Okay, so I've seen it thirty times, and each time manages to be just as beautiful as the last.\" \"How? You've lost everyone you've ever loved, seen the world blown to pieces again and again. How can you still be in love with that damn circle? You know I told you that as a joke.\" \"It doesn't matter.

This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second. I see the family dog lying on her bed. Or, rather, what's left of it. It's hard to make out this late, but all I can see is shredded blanket. The dog cowers in the back.

If you were smart, you would end your lives now while you still had the chance.\" We all looked at the screen in horror. Should we try to make another one? Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand.

They were long and meandering, more adventuresome than your simple afternoon stroll. We would walk, hand in hand, and observe things about our environment. It was what we loved to do. Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose.

        "Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere they are less dense and thus tend to have less attraction due to gravity.",

Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

The girl gasped, thinking Death had come for her. But to her surprise, the figure removed its hood, revealing a kind and gentle face.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked, cautiously.\n\n\"I am Life,\" the figure replied. \"And Death is no more. I have come to offer you and all those who seek it, the gift of eternal life.\"\n\nOverwhelmed by the enormity of the offer, the girl hesitated for a moment before accepting, and with that",
        "Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her eyes brimming with tears. She clutched her favorite stuffed animal, a worn-out teddy bear with one missing eye. \"Don't leave me, you're my best friend,\" she whispered to the bear. She had just learned that her family was moving to a new city, and she was terrified of leaving everything she had ever known.\n\nAs she sat there, a small voice in her head reminded her of all the adventures she had shared with her teddy bear. From tea parties to secret hideouts, he had always been there for her. She knew that no matter where they went, he would be her constant companion.\n\nWith a newfound sense of determination, the little girl wiped away her tears and hugged her teddy bear tight. She knew that even if everything else changed, their friendship would remain strong. And with that thought, she looked forward to the new adventures that awaited her.",
        "Explain a piece of modern technology to a person from around 100-500 CE. \"Look, are you even trying to understand? It's called a smartphone. It's a small device that you carry with you everywhere you go. It allows you to make phone calls, send text messages, and access information on the internet. You can check the weather, read the news, and even watch videos on it. \n\nIt's like having a miniature library, communication center, and entertainment system all in one. You can take pictures with it, listen to music, and even use it as a GPS to find your way around town. \n\nThe screen is made of glass, and it responds to touch. You can move your finger across it to scroll, and tap on icons to open different apps. \n\nIt's powered by a rechargeable battery that you can plug into a wall outlet or a computer to charge. And you can customize it with different cases and accessories to make it your own. \n\nIt's hard to imagine life without a smartphone now, but it's only been around for a relatively short time. It's amazing how much technology",

        "A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the river and walk down to the beach. The sun is setting and the light is golden. The waves are gentle and the sand is still warm. I see something glistening in the sand and walk over to investigate. It's a bottle, covered in barnacles and seaweed, with a piece of paper inside.\n\nI carefully pull out the paper and unfold it. The handwriting is faded, but still legible. It's a letter from my great-grandfather, written over a century ago. He had tossed the bottle into the ocean as a message to his future family, hoping that it would find its way to them.\n\nAs I read the words, I feel a deep connection to my past and my family history. It's a reminder that even though time passes and people come and go, our stories and legacies continue on. I carefully tuck the letter back into the bottle and decide to toss it back into the ocean, hoping that it will find its way to another member of my",

        "The running faucet The faucet had a third knob. She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the spout. She tried the knob on the right, and cold water came out. But what about the middle knob? She hesitated for a moment before turning it and was surprised to hear a hissing sound. Suddenly, the water started flowing out of the faucet with a force she had never seen before. She tried to turn it off, but it wouldn't budge.\n\nShe decided to call a plumber, but they couldn't come until the next day. The running faucet kept her up all night. She began to notice something strange about the water; it was almost glowing. She dipped her finger in the stream, and it tingled. She started to feel a little dizzy and light-headed.\n\nThe next morning, the plumber arrived and took one look at the running faucet. He chuckled and said he knew what was wrong. He twisted the middle knob, and the water stopped immediately. He explained that it was a special knob that controlled the water pressure and that it was only used in emergencies"

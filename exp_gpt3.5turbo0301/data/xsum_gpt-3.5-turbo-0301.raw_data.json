        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb said.

        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack.",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\"",

She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station.

The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein,\" she said.

The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It",

The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace.

It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT.

The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a",

        "The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of \"buildings as power stations\". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid.

Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a \"professional\" way, some officers still displayed \"negative and uninformed\" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: \"A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.\" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would \"slip through the net\". In response, the College of Policing is setting up a pilot scheme to help officers identify possible patterns of abusive behaviour.

Its bankruptcy is likely to have ripple effects throughout the industry, particularly in Asia where the company has a significant presence.\n\nAnalysts are warning that other struggling shipping companies may follow Hanjin\u2019s lead, as the sector grapples with falling freight rates and rising debt levels. The global economic slowdown and ongoing trade disputes are also contributing to the industry\u2019s woes.

The incident happened at Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas Airport, and the thieves escaped with jewels and diamonds worth millions of dollars.\n\nThe Spanish police have launched an investigation and are looking for the suspects who fled the scene in two cars.

The proposed development has faced some opposition from locals, who are concerned about the impact it could have on the historic building and the local area.\n\nDespite the opposition, PegasusLife has received support from some quarters, with some arguing that the development will help to address the country's housing crisis and provide much-needed accommodation for older people.\n\nThe fate of the Lyndhurst Park Hotel remains uncertain, but it seems likely that the building will soon be replaced by a new, modern development"

This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest.

Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once.
